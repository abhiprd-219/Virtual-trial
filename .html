   <p class ="bro"></br>As we see in our day to day life that People order different fashion wears from various websites and due to size difference they had to return it,Its really Time taking. Our app will bring revolutionary development in this field. AI will predict our Size from our avatar and if its wrongly predicted we can even change it manually like customizing waist size,chest size,length of hands , legs ,neck to waist distance etc. and as the size mentioned of the cloth on website matches with the manual body size,it will return fit. If it's little loose it will return for example 6 mm loose. If cloth length is less than your body size, It will return (Not fit, Very Tight etc).
